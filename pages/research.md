    Agriculture, forestry and other land use contribute about a fifth of total anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Mitigation efforts have emphasized “decoupling” that sustains production while lowering emissions per unit of output. However, the underlying decoupling mechanisms have not been fully characterized. We rely on a mathematical identity to decompose agricultural GHG emissions growth (ΔE) into 3 parts: output (ΔY), emissions per unit of input (ΔE/X) and output per unit of input (ΔY/X) or Total Factor Productivity (TFP). We then rely on official country-level data to quantify the historical contribution of these components. Over 1961-2021, we find that TFP growth —which captures the sector’s ability to produce more output per unit of measured input— has consistently remained one of the main sources of GHG emissions reduction within farms. Further decomposition reveals a key role for rising land productivity in reducing emission intensity.

    Current agri-environmental policies are failing to match the scale, complexity, and urgency of today’s environmental challenges. Despite a proliferation of regulations and laws, agri-environmental payment schemes, and policy frameworks, agriculture remains a leading driver of biodiversity loss, soil degradation, nutrient pollution, and greenhouse-gas emissions. Agri-environmental policies are frequently criticized for falling short of their environmental objectives, misallocating public funds, constraining farmers’ agency, and generating substantial administrative burdens. A transformation of policy instruments is needed to overcome persistent challenges that include designing policy instruments that effectively align the incentives of all actors, ensuring robust monitoring and enforcement of compliance, managing trade-offs across environmental and economic goals, and establishing mechanisms for adaptive learning and performance improvement over time. In this paper, we aim to show how recent advances in Earth observation technologies can contribute to such a transformation.

    Legislation promoting large-scale solar could potentially elevate farmland prices. Using approximately 12,000 farmland transactions (2007–2021), we study the impact of the 2015 Shared Renewable Program and relevant policies in New York state. We find that large solar-suitable parcels within two miles of substations sold for 15%–18% more than comparable parcels farther away after the program's implementation. This effect is absent for parcels unsuitable for solar yet desirable for housing, suggesting it is unrelated to housing pressure. We also find a stronger effect on farmland in regions with higher electricity prices (~20%) suggesting SRP’s impact varies by location and time.

    Increasing agricultural productivity is a gradual process with significant time lags between research and development (R&D) investment and the resulting gains. We estimate the response of US agricultural Total Factor Productivity to both R&D investment and weather and quantify the public R&D spending required to offset the emerging impacts of climate change. We find that offsetting the climate-induced productivity slowdown by 2050 will require R&D spending over 2021 to 2050 to grow at 5.2 to 7.8% per year under a fixed spending growth scenario or by an additional $2.2 to $3.8B per year under a fixed supplement spending scenario (in addition to the current spending of ~$5B per year). This amounts to an additional $208 to $434B or $65 to $113B over the period, respectively, and would be comparable in ambition to the public R&D spending growth that followed the two World Wars.

    Research on agricultural prices and deforestation has mostly focused on cash crops and export-oriented commodities. We develop a theoretical framework to illustrate how a staple food price shock can lead to deforestation through various channels. We explore our theoretical predictions with data from Cambodia and use a shift-share instrumental variables strategy. We find that shocks to the price of rice explain most of Cambodia’s recent deforestation. To shed light on mechanisms, we use household data to study land use behavior and welfare. Our findings suggest that staple food prices have a more important role in driving deforestation than previously thought.

    Intensive agriculture creates multiple environmental challenges, including runoff of excess nutrients, use of chemical pesticides, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions. Curbing these negative effects of agriculture while feeding a growing global population is already a massive challenge and one that will likely be exacerbated by climate change. Yang et al. reviewed the research on interactions between climate change and agriculture’s environmental impacts and found that most of this work suggests even greater challenges to come. —Bianca Lopez

    <span style="color:#AAAAAA">
    A warming climate expands the frost-free season, plausibly allowing for increased cropping intensity in temperate regions. This paper assesses the potential of multiple cropping to offset the projected negative effects of climate change on agricultural yields in the United States. We use cross-sectional variation in observed land cover, soil characteristics, and climate to estimate farmers' propensity to double-crop winter wheat with soybeans. Our estimates imply that under current economic conditions, a 3°C warming would result in an increase of 2.1 percentage points in the share of current soybean area double cropped, primarily driven by expansions in cooler regions. A fixed-effects panel model of county yields further indicates that yields of double-cropped soybeans are about 12% lower than those of single-cropped soybeans. Accounting for changes in cropping intensity and attendant effects on soybean yields, we project that at current prices, a 3°C warming would induce a shift in cropping intensity that increases revenue from soy systems by 1.3% overall, offsetting only a small fraction of the revenue impacts of predicted yield declines.

    Projected increases in food demand driven by population growth coupled with heightened agricultural vulnerability to climate change jointly pose severe threats to global food security in the coming decades, especially for developing nations. By providing real-time and low-cost observations, satellite remote sensing has been widely employed to estimate crop yield across various scales. Most such efforts are based on statistical approaches that require large amounts of ground measurements for model training/calibration, which may be challenging to obtain on a large scale in developing countries that are most food-insecure and climate-vulnerable. In this paper, we develop a generalizable framework that is mechanism-guided and practically parsimonious for crop yield estimation. We then apply this framework to estimate crop yield for two crops (corn and wheat) in two contrasting regions, the US Corn Belt US-CB, and India’s Indo–Gangetic plain Wheat Belt IGP-WB, respectively. This framework is based on the mechanistic light reactions (MLR) model utilizing remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) as a major input. We compared the performance of MLR to two commonly used machine learning (ML) algorithms: artificial neural network and random forest. We found that MLR-SIF has comparable performance to ML algorithms in US-CB, where abundant and high-quality ground measurements of crop yield are routinely available (for model calibration). In IGP-WB, MLR-SIF significantly outperforms ML algorithms. These results demonstrate the potential advantage of MLR-SIF for yield estimation in developing countries where ground truth data is limited in quantity and quality. In addition, high-resolution and crop-specific satellite SIF is crucial for accurate yield estimation. Therefore, harnessing the mechanism-guided MLR-SIF and rapidly growing satellite SIF measurements (with high resolution and crop-specificity) hold promise to enhance food security in developing countries towards more effective responses to food crises, agricultural policies, and more efficient commodity pricing.

    Climate scientists project rising average temperatures and increasing frequency of temperature extremes. We study how extreme temperatures affect corporate profitability across different industries and whether sell-side analysts understand these relationships. We combine granular daily data on temperatures across the continental U.S. with locations of public companies’ establishments and build a panel of quarterly firm-level temperature exposures. Extreme temperatures significantly impact earnings in over 40% of industries, with bi-directional effects that harm some industries while others benefit. Analysts and investors do not immediately react to observable intra-quarter temperature shocks, though earnings forecasts account for temperature effects by quarter-end in many industries.

We articulate some of the missing linkages and pose key policy research questions concerning structural transformation and the complex feedback among agriculture, nature, and economic growth processes, especially in low-income agrarian economies.

    Climate change is posing new challenges to crop-related concerns, including food insecurity, supply stability, and economic planning. Accurately predicting crop yields is crucial for addressing these challenges. However, this prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on numerous factors such as weather, land surface, and soil quality, as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts crop yields at the county level nationwide. We also laid a solid foundation by comparing our model on a nationwide scale with other well-known baseline methods, including linear models, tree-based models, and deep learning methods. Experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal information.
