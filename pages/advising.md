## Prospective PhD students

I am currently open to advising graduate students in various academic fields at Cornell: 
- [Applied Economics and Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/graduate/phd/) (AEM)
- [Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/phd/) (PAM)
- [Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/prospective-incoming-grad-students) (ECON)
- [Natural Resources](https://cals.cornell.edu/natural-resources-environment/degrees-programs/graduate) (NRE) 

These programs have different admissions criteria. Please consult the respective websites for more details.

The AEM, PAM and ECON PhD programs are fully funded and admission decisions are made by a committee and not by individual faculty. As a result, it is not necessary to reach out to me before applying. I am happy to discuss your fit before applying but note I have no influence in admissions.

In contrast, the NRE PhD program is largely externally funded. Prospective students typically secure external support (e.g. Fulbright scholarship) before reaching out to me to discuss fit.
