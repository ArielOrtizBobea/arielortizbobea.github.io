## Prospective PhD students

I advise graduate students in various academic fields at Cornell: 
- [Applied Economics and Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/graduate/phd/) (AEM)
- [Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/phd/) (PAM)
- [Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/prospective-incoming-grad-students) (ECON)
- [Natural Resources](https://cals.cornell.edu/natural-resources-environment/degrees-programs/graduate) (NRE) 

These programs have different admissions criteria. Please consult the respective websites for more details.

The AEM, PAM and ECON PhD programs are fully funded and admission decisions are made by a committee and not by individual faculty. The NRE PhD program is largely externally funded; prospective students typically secure some external support before applying (e.g. Fulbright scholarship).
