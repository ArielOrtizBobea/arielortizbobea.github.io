## postdocs

- [Postdoctoral Associate position](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/31576) working on quantifying the private value of soil health improvements in U.S. agricutlure (Apply by Feb 15, 2006. Expected start date in Spring/Summer of 2026)

## PhD students

I can advise grad students in various fields at Cornell: 
- [Applied Economics and Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/graduate/phd/) (AEM)
- [Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/phd/) (PAM)
- [Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/prospective-incoming-grad-students) (ECON)
- [Natural Resources](https://cals.cornell.edu/natural-resources-environment/degrees-programs/graduate) (NRE) 

These programs have different admissions criteria. Please consult the respective websites for more details.

The AEM, PAM and ECON PhD programs are fully funded and admission decisions are made by a committee and not by individual faculty. When applying to thos e programs just mention your interest in working with me in your application. No need to contact me directly.

In contrast, the NRE PhD program is largely externally funded. Prospective students typically secure external support (e.g. Fulbright scholarship) before reaching out to me to discuss fit.

## Visitors

I can sometimes host faculty and PhD candidates working on similar issues. If interested, please email me with a plan stating 1- your goals and why my group is a good match, 2- financial support and 3- a timeline.
