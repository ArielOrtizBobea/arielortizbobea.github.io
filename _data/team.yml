    My research focuses on developing machine learning techniques for challenging problems in sustainability and agriculture. 
    My work has numerous applications including crop yield forecasting, carbon cycle modeling, vegetation monitoring, and detecting fish 
    farms in the Amazon using satellite imagery. I work with experts in agricultural economics, crop science, plant genetics, and ecology,
    to develop innovative AI solutions that can benefit their fields.
